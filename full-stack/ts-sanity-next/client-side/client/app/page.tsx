  /*Note Kapeche uses a custom gradien to make the H1 look fun. I will need to look into that later. 
  
  
  Kapeche uses a div with styling to surround the different post contents. 
  
  
  I think that I need to add the many different folders to accept Tailwind. I think if I have it added, it'll adjust automatically. 
  
  
  I will also need to find a way to get the speed published. 
  
  For publishing, Kapeche is going to go to the git panel (I am not ready to publish it as an app quite yet). She has it published on an app. Kapeche recommends adding it to Vercel.  That shows the one that we just created. Project name is next-sanity, framework project NextJS, we don't need to change many of the settings. Just click deploy. 
  
  Click on the new project that you just created. You can click there. Just like it looked on local. 
  
  What's cool is that if you're editing the studio loaclly or on the production site, the deployed website can see that you are being in production. Just like in google cloud, you get the real time update since it's backed up by Sanity's content lake. We went from having no NextJS website to creating our own website, and, we have a /admin site to work with and we can work with other websites as we create them. */
